## GO:

- Go is a compiled language
- Go is `faster` than the interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript

### Commands:

```bash
 go mod init <module-name>
 go run main.go
 go build && ./<module-name>
 go install
```

### Statically & Strongly Typed:

- Go is both `statically` typed and `strongly` typed language.
- Go enforces static typing meaning variable types are `known` before the code runs.
- Strongly typed meaning the variable types are `fixed` and cannot be changed.
